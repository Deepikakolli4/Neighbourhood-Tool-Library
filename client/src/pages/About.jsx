      <h1>About Neighborhood Tool Library</h1>
      <p>
        The Neighborhood Tool Library is a community-driven platform that allows
        local residents to borrow tools and equipment for personal use. Our goal is
        to make high-quality tools easily accessible while reducing the need for
        individuals to purchase expensive equipment they only need occasionally.
      </p>
      <h2>Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Our mission is to promote sustainability, cost-effectiveness, and community
        cooperation. By sharing tools, we aim to reduce waste and foster a culture of
        sharing within local neighborhoods.
      </p>
      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>1. Browse Tools:</strong> Browse our catalog of tools available for borrowing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2. Reserve Tools:</strong> Select the tool you need, pick your reservation dates, and confirm your booking.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>3. Pickup/Return:</strong> Pick up the tool from a designated location, use it for the reserved time, and return it when done.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4. Report Damage:</strong> If a tool is damaged, report it via the platform to help us keep everything in good condition.
      </p>
